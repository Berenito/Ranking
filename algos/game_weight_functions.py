"""
Functions used in the stage 2 of the BlockRankingAlgorithm class ranking procedure - obtaining game weight
for each game in the dataset. (They are not intended to be called directly)
During the ranking procedure, get_game_weight wrapper function is called and it will call desired game-weight function.
Other, specific game-weight functions should have format game_wght = game_weight_func(**kwargs).
